* “Novel view synthesis from a sparse set of input images is a challenging problem of great practical interest, especially when camera poses are absent or inaccurate” (Jiang et al., 2024, p. 1)

* “we also apply a low-pass filtering to avoid high-frequency artifacts as shown in Fig. 10 (a).” (Jiang et al., 2024, p. 2)
* “we leverage 2D correspondences between the reconstructed scene and training views for effective optimization of camera poses and the reconstructed scene.” (Jiang et al., 2024, p. 3)
* “pixels in Ik+1 are back-projected based on the aligned depth Dk+1. After processing all n views, we reach a coarse solution for sparse view synthesis.” (Jiang et al., 2024, p. 4)

* “The camera pose is optimized in both registration and adjustment, but the alignment of depth is achieved through the adjustment only.” (Jiang et al., 2024, p. 4)
