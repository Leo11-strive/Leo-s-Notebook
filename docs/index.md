# Welcome to My Digital Notebook

Welcome to my personal space for learning, reflection, and growth. This digital notebook is where I organize my thoughts, document my study progress, and share insights on a variety of topics that capture my interest.

I firmly believe that the process of writing and organizing knowledge is one of the most effective ways to learn. By articulating complex concepts and connecting different ideas, I can not only solidify my own understanding but also create a valuable resource for others who may be on a similar journey.

Here, you will find a collection of my notes, summaries, and reflections on:

- **Academic Courses:** Detailed notes and insights from my studies at Zhejiang University.
- **Self-Learning:** Explorations into new technologies, programming languages, and personal projects.
- **Research:** Summaries and analyses of academic papers and my own research endeavors.

I hope you find this notebook to be a source of inspiration and knowledge. Thank you for visiting, and I invite you to explore the various sections to see what I've been working on.
