    <center>CA is a course following computer organization design, aiming at quantitatively evaluating the performance of computer systems and designing more complex CPUs on FPGA. Despite being an hardware course, understanding the basic principles of computer architecture is essential for software engineers, especially for us interested in AI for ultization of computer hardware to exploit performance, which DeepSeek has been doing. </center>
